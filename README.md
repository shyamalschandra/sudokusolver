# sudokusolver
A sudoku solver written in Python.  GUI and backend undefined.

**Project Title:**  Advanced Sudoku Techniques with Optimized Candidate Generation

**Duration:** 1-2 months

**Problem:** Many common Sudoku solvers heavily rely on brute-force backtracking methods. This can get computationally expensive, especially for very complex puzzles. The goal of this project is to research, implement, and optimize advanced Sudoku solving techniques for greater efficiency.

**Tasks for the Applicant:**

1. **Research:** 
   * Deeply investigate advanced Sudoku solving techniques beyond backtracking. Some examples:
     * X-Wing, Swordfish, Hidden Singles/Doubles/Triples, etc.  
     * Pattern-based inference (e.g., Unique Rectangles) 
     * Lookahead and hypothetical analysis
   * Consider open-source Sudoku libraries to understand existing approaches.

2. **Implementation:**
   * Choose at least 2-3 advanced techniques from the research phase.
   * Implement those techniques within an existing Sudoku engine (either provide a basic engine or ask them to create a simple one).
   * Create unit tests to ensure the correctness of the new techniques.

3. **Candidate Generation Optimization:**
   * Analyze the current methods of generating possible candidates for empty cells in your Sudoku engine.
   * Research optimization techniques (e.g., data structures, bitwise operations, constraint propagation) 
   * Implement the chosen optimization and benchmark its impact.

4. **Puzzle Complexity Evaluation:**
   * Research or develop a metric to determine the "difficulty" of Sudoku puzzles.
   * Test the engine with a wide range of difficulty levels,  measuring time and solution paths.

**Deliverables:**

* Source code with well-documented implementations of the advanced techniques and optimizations.
* Unit tests for the implemented techniques.
* A report outlining:
  * The chosen techniques and rationale for their selection.
  * Optimization strategies and analysis of their performance gain.
  * Evaluation of the engine's performance across different difficulty levels.

**Applicant Evaluation:**

* **Code Quality:**  Is the code readable, maintainable, and well-structured?
* **Correctness:** Do the implementations work as intended and produce valid Sudoku solutions?
* **Technical Understanding:** Demonstrated through implementation choices and the report.
* **Problem-solving:**  The ability to research, select, and implement suitable advanced techniques.
* **Optimization Mindset:** Clear improvement in efficiency through the optimization process.
* **Communication:**  Well-written report, clear comments, and potential presentations.

**Additional Notes**

* **Flexibility:** Allow applicants to showcase their strengths by potentially choosing their preferred programming language (ideally Python, Java, or C++ for wider accessibility).
* **Datasets:** Provide a collection of Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty or advise on obtaining such datasets.
* **Mentorship:**  Consider offering limited mentorship during the project to guide them and provide feedback.
